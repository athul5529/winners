🚀 Project Title

AI-Based Online Answer Sheet Evaluation System

🔍 Problem Statement

Manual evaluation of handwritten answer sheets is time-consuming and prone to human errors. Teachers spend significant effort reviewing student answers, comparing them with model answers, and assigning marks. Existing digital systems do not effectively support handwritten answer evaluation or intelligent error identification, making the process inefficient and inaccurate.

💡 Proposed Solution

This project proposes an AI-based online evaluation system where teachers upload model answers and students upload handwritten answer sheets. The system uses OCR to convert images into text and NLP techniques to compare student answers with teacher-provided answers. Marks are generated automatically, and unidentified or mismatched answers are highlighted in red for human correction.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Backend: Python (Django)

Database: MySQL

APIs / Services: OCR and NLP APIs

🤖 AI Tools Used (Optional)

OCR (Optical Character Recognition) – Converts handwritten images into text

NLP Libraries (SpaCy / NLTK) – Text comparison and evaluation

⭐ Key Features

Teacher uploads model answer images

Student uploads handwritten answer sheets

OCR converts images into editable text

Automated evaluation using NLP

Unidentified errors highlighted in red for human correction

🔮 Future Scope

AI-based handwriting improvement and confidence scoring

Multi-language answer evaluation

Automated feedback generation for students

Integration with institutional learning management systems
